  dialogue:
  - This is now your second day, now your energy has completely recovered. Most days
    will proceed the same way as the first one did.
  - While resting your energy will recover at a faster rate and when you rest until
    the next day your energy will have fully recovered.
  - You'll spend your energy collecting materials and in turn use them to construct
    other houses and structures as well as tools to expand your city.
  - As your expansion continues the knowledge you gain will become more profound.
  - With it you'll be able to make breakthroughs to push your city into a whole new
    era. You can check their progress by pressing the progress button.
  - One last thing, as the growth of your city persists, you'll find people wanting
    to move into your city. You can accept them or refuse them as you wish.
  - If you accept them, you'll become capable of sending them out to gather certain
    materials for you.
