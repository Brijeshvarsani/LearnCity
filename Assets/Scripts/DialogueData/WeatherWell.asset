  - 'I must inform that the weather won''t always good. There will be days where
    heavy rain will pour and storms will pass by. '
  - Although those won't be pleasant days, you can still make use of them by collecting
    the water from the rain to recuperate a bit of energy.
  - To collect that water you will have to dig out a well that will be connected
    to an undergroud water pocket.
  - The well will serve as a water resevoir that can be occasionally refilled with
    the rains and storms.
  - For it's construction you will need to press the Building button, select the
    structure option, press on the well icon and then select a spot on the ground
    to sart digging.
