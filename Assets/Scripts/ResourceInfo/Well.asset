  Name: Well
  description: A well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging,
    driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water. The oldest and
    most common kind of well is a water well, to access groundwater in underground
    aquifers. The well water is drawn up by a pump, or using containers, such as
    buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand. Water can also be injected
    back into the aquifer through the well. Wells were first constructed at least
    eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple
    scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of Iran, and the stepwells
    and sakiehs of India. Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability,
    and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age.
