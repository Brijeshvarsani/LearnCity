  Name: Oak Tree
  description: "An oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus (/\u02C8kw\u025C\u02D0rk\u0259s/;[1]
    Latin \"oak tree\") of the beech family, Fagaceae. There are approximately 500
    extant species of oaks.[2] The common name \"oak\" also appears in the names
    of species in related genera, notably Lithocarpus (stone oaks), as well as in
    those of unrelated species such as Grevillea robusta (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae
    (she-oaks). The genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes
    deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes
    in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America has the largest
    number of oak species, with approximately 160 species in Mexico of which 109
    are endemic and about 90 in the United States. The second greatest area of oak
    diversity is China, with approximately 100 species.[3]"
